However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowl-\\nedge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance\\nlags behind task-speciﬁc architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their\\ndecisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-\\ntrained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric\\nmemory have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We\\nexplore a general-purpose ﬁne-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation\\n(RAG) — models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric mem-\\nory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric\\nmemory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense\\nvector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We com-\\npare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages\\nacross the whole generated sequence, and another which can use different passages\\nper token. We ﬁne-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-\\nintensive NLP tasks and set the state of the art on three open domain QA tasks,\\noutperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-speciﬁc retrieve-and-extract\\narchitectures. For language generation tasks, we ﬁnd that RAG models generate\\nmore speciﬁc, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only\\nseq2seq baseline.\\n1 Introduction\\nPre-trained neural language models have been shown to learn a substantial amount of in-depth knowl-\\nedge from data [ 47]. They can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized\\nimplicit knowledge base [ 51,52]. While this development is exciting, such models do have down-\\nsides: They cannot easily expand or revise their memory, can’t straightforwardly provide insight into\\ntheir predictions, and may produce “hallucinations” [ 38]. Hybrid models that combine parametric\\nmemory with non-parametric (i.e., retrieval-based) memories [ 20,26,48] can address some of these\\nissues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be\\ninspected and interpreted. REALM [ 20] and ORQA [ 31], two recently introduced models that\\ncombine masked language models [ 8] with a differentiable retriever, have shown promising results,arXiv:2005.11401v4  [cs.CL]  12 Apr 2021', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We combine a pre-trained retriever ( Query Encoder +Document\\nIndex ) with a pre-trained seq2seq model ( Generator ) and ﬁne-tune end-to-end. For query x, we use\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) to ﬁnd the top-K documents zi. For ﬁnal prediction y, we\\ntreatzas a latent variable and marginalize over seq2seq predictions given different documents.\\nbut have only explored open-domain extractive question answering. Here, we bring hybrid parametric\\nand non-parametric memory to the “workhorse of NLP,” i.e. sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models.\\nWe endow pre-trained, parametric-memory generation models with a non-parametric memory through\\na general-purpose ﬁne-tuning approach which we refer to as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\\nWe build RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq transformer, and the\\nnon-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural\\nretriever. We combine these components in a probabilistic model trained end-to-end (Fig. 1). The\\nretriever (Dense Passage Retriever [ 26], henceforth DPR) provides latent documents conditioned on\\nthe input, and the seq2seq model (BART [ 32]) then conditions on these latent documents together with\\nthe input to generate the output. We marginalize the latent documents with a top-K approximation,\\neither on a per-output basis (assuming the same document is responsible for all tokens) or a per-token\\nbasis (where different documents are responsible for different tokens). Like T5 [ 51] or BART, RAG\\ncan be ﬁne-tuned on any seq2seq task, whereby both the generator and retriever are jointly learned.\\nThere has been extensive previous work proposing architectures to enrich systems with non-parametric\\nmemory which are trained from scratch for speciﬁc tasks, e.g. memory networks [ 64,55], stack-\\naugmented networks [ 25] and memory layers [ 30]. In contrast, we explore a setting where both\\nparametric and non-parametric memory components are pre-trained and pre-loaded with extensive\\nknowledge. Crucially, by using pre-trained access mechanisms, the ability to access knowledge is\\npresent without additional training.\\nOur results highlight the beneﬁts of combining parametric and non-parametric memory with genera-\\ntion for knowledge-intensive tasks —tasks that humans could not reasonably be expected to perform\\nwithout access to an external knowledge source. Our RAG models achieve state-of-the-art results\\non open Natural Questions [ 29], WebQuestions [ 3] and CuratedTrec [ 2] and strongly outperform\\nrecent approaches that use specialised pre-training objectives on TriviaQA [ 24]. Despite these being\\nextractive tasks, we ﬁnd that unconstrained generation outperforms previous extractive approaches.\\nFor knowledge-intensive generation, we experiment with MS-MARCO [ 1] and Jeopardy question\\ngeneration, and we ﬁnd that our models generate responses that are more factual, speciﬁc, and\\ndiverse than a BART baseline. For FEVER [ 56] fact veriﬁcation, we achieve results within 4.3% of\\nstate-of-the-art pipeline models which use strong retrieval supervision. Finally, we demonstrate that\\nthe non-parametric memory can be replaced to update the models’ knowledge as the world changes.1\\n2 Methods\\nWe explore RAG models, which use the input sequence xto retrieve text documents zand use them\\nas additional context when generating the target sequence y. As shown in Figure 1, our models\\nleverage two components: (i) a retriever pη(z|x)with parameters ηthat returns (top-K truncated)\\ndistributions over text passages given a query xand (ii) a generator pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1)parametrized\\n1Code to run experiments with RAG has been open-sourced as part of the HuggingFace Transform-\\ners Library [ 66] and can be found at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/\\nexamples/rag/ .

In one approach, RAG-Sequence , the model uses the same document\\nto predict each target token. The second approach, RAG-Token , can predict each target token based\\non a different document. In the following, we formally introduce both models and then describe the\\npηandpθcomponents, as well as the training and decoding procedure.\\n2.1 Models\\nRAG-Sequence Model The RAG-Sequence model uses the same retrieved document to generate\\nthe complete sequence . Technically, it treats the retrieved document as a single latent variable that\\nis marginalized to get the seq2seq probability p(y|x)via a top-K approximation. Concretely, the\\ntop K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and the generator produces the output sequence\\nprobability for each document, which are then marginalized,\\npRAG-Sequence (y|x)≈∑\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))pη(z|x)pθ(y|x,z) =∑\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))pη(z|x)N∏\\nipθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1)\\nRAG-Token Model In the RAG-Token model we can draw a different latent document for each\\ntarget token and marginalize accordingly. This allows the generator to choose content from several\\ndocuments when producing an answer. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the\\nretriever, and then the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document,\\nbefore marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, Formally, we deﬁne:\\npRAG-Token (y|x)≈N∏\\ni∑\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))pη(z|x)pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1)\\nFinally, we note that RAG can be used for sequence classiﬁcation tasks by considering the target class\\nas a target sequence of length one, in which case RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token are equivalent.\\n2.2 Retriever: DPR\\nThe retrieval component pη(z|x)is based on DPR [26]. DPR follows a bi-encoder architecture:\\npη(z|x)∝exp(\\nd(z)⊤q(x))\\nd(z) =BERTd(z),q(x) =BERTq(x)\\nwhere d(z)is a dense representation of a document produced by a BERT BASE document encoder [8],\\nandq(x)a query representation produced by a query encoder , also based on BERT BASE. Calculating\\ntop-k (pη(·|x)), the list ofkdocumentszwith highest prior probability pη(z|x), is a Maximum Inner\\nProduct Search (MIPS) problem, which can be approximately solved in sub-linear time [ 23]. We use\\na pre-trained bi-encoder from DPR to initialize our retriever and to build the document index. This\\nretriever was trained to retrieve documents which contain answers to TriviaQA [ 24] questions and\\nNatural Questions [29]. We refer to the document index as the non-parametric memory .\\n2.3 Generator: BART\\nThe generator component pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1)could be modelled using any encoder-decoder. We use\\nBART-large [ 32], a pre-trained seq2seq transformer [ 58] with 400M parameters. To combine the input\\nxwith the retrieved content zwhen generating from BART, we simply concatenate them. BART was\\npre-trained using a denoising objective and a variety of different noising functions. It has obtained\\nstate-of-the-art results on a diverse set of generation tasks and outperforms comparably-sized T5\\nmodels [32]. We refer to the BART generator parameters θas the parametric memory henceforth.\\n2.4 Training\\nWe jointly train the retriever and generator components without any direct supervision on what\\ndocument should be retrieved.

Instead, we run beam search for\\neach document z, scoring each hypothesis using pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1). This yields a set of hypotheses\\nY, some of which may not have appeared in the beams of all documents. To estimate the probability\\nof an hypothesis ywe run an additional forward pass for each document zfor whichydoes not\\nappear in the beam, multiply generator probability with pη(z|x)and then sum the probabilities across\\nbeams for the marginals. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Thorough Decoding.” For longer\\noutput sequences,|Y|can become large, requiring many forward passes. For more efﬁcient decoding,\\nwe can make a further approximation that pθ(y|x,zi)≈0whereywas not generated during beam\\nsearch from x,zi. This avoids the need to run additional forward passes once the candidate set Yhas\\nbeen generated. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Fast Decoding.”\\n3 Experiments\\nWe experiment with RAG in a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks. For all experiments, we use\\na single Wikipedia dump for our non-parametric knowledge source. Following Lee et al. [31] and\\nKarpukhin et al. [26], we use the December 2018 dump. Each Wikipedia article is split into disjoint\\n100-word chunks, to make a total of 21M documents. We use the document encoder to compute an\\nembedding for each document, and build a single MIPS index using FAISS [ 23] with a Hierarchical\\nNavigable Small World approximation for fast retrieval [ 37]. During training, we retrieve the top\\nkdocuments for each query. We consider k∈{5,10}for training and set kfor test time using dev\\ndata. We now discuss experimental details for each task.\\n3.1 Open-domain Question Answering\\nOpen-domain question answering (QA) is an important real-world application and common testbed\\nfor knowledge-intensive tasks [ 20]. We treat questions and answers as input-output text pairs (x,y)\\nand train RAG by directly minimizing the negative log-likelihood of answers. We compare RAG to\\nthe popular extractive QA paradigm [ 5,7,31,26], where answers are extracted spans from retrieved\\ndocuments, relying primarily on non-parametric knowledge. We also compare to “Closed-Book\\nQA” approaches [ 52], which, like RAG, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead\\nrelying purely on parametric knowledge. We consider four popular open-domain QA datasets: Natural\\nQuestions (NQ) [ 29], TriviaQA (TQA) [ 24]. WebQuestions (WQ) [ 3] and CuratedTrec (CT) [ 2]. As\\nCT and WQ are small, we follow DPR [ 26] by initializing CT and WQ models with our NQ RAG\\nmodel. We use the same train/dev/test splits as prior work [ 31,26] and report Exact Match (EM)\\nscores. For TQA, to compare with T5 [52], we also evaluate on the TQA Wiki test set.\\n3.2 Abstractive Question Answering\\nRAG models can go beyond simple extractive QA and answer questions with free-form, abstractive\\ntext generation. To test RAG’s natural language generation (NLG) in a knowledge-intensive setting,\\nwe use the MSMARCO NLG task v2.1 [ 43]. The task consists of questions, ten gold passages\\nretrieved from a search engine for each question, and a full sentence answer annotated from the\\nretrieved passages.

MSMARCO has some questions that cannot be\\nanswered in a way that matches the reference answer without access to the gold passages, such as\\n“What is the weather in V olcano, CA?” so performance will be lower without using gold passages.\\nWe also note that some MSMARCO questions cannot be answered using Wikipedia alone. Here,\\nRAG can rely on parametric knowledge to generate reasonable responses.\\n3.3 Jeopardy Question Generation\\nTo evaluate RAG’s generation abilities in a non-QA setting, we study open-domain question gen-\\neration. Rather than use questions from standard open-domain QA tasks, which typically consist\\nof short, simple questions, we propose the more demanding task of generating Jeopardy questions.\\nJeopardy is an unusual format that consists of trying to guess an entity from a fact about that entity.\\nFor example, “The World Cup” is the answer to the question “In 1986 Mexico scored as the ﬁrst\\ncountry to host this international sports competition twice.” As Jeopardy questions are precise,\\nfactual statements, generating Jeopardy questions conditioned on their answer entities constitutes a\\nchallenging knowledge-intensive generation task.\\nWe use the splits from SearchQA [ 10], with 100K train, 14K dev, and 27K test examples. As\\nthis is a new task, we train a BART model for comparison. Following [ 67], we evaluate using the\\nSQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 metric [ 42]. Q-BLEU is a variant of BLEU with a higher weight for\\nmatching entities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than\\nstandard metrics. We also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and\\none for speciﬁcity. We deﬁne factuality as whether a statement can be corroborated by trusted external\\nsources, and speciﬁcity as high mutual dependence between the input and output [ 33]. We follow\\nbest practice and use pairwise comparative evaluation [ 34]. Evaluators are shown an answer and two\\ngenerated questions, one from BART and one from RAG. They are then asked to pick one of four\\noptions—quuestion A is better, question B is better, both are good, or neither is good.\\n3.4 Fact Veriﬁcation\\nFEVER [ 56] requires classifying whether a natural language claim is supported or refuted by\\nWikipedia, or whether there is not enough information to decide. The task requires retrieving\\nevidence from Wikipedia relating to the claim and then reasoning over this evidence to classify\\nwhether the claim is true, false, or unveriﬁable from Wikipedia alone. FEVER is a retrieval problem\\ncoupled with an challenging entailment reasoning task. It also provides an appropriate testbed for\\nexploring the RAG models’ ability to handle classiﬁcation rather than generation. We map FEVER\\nclass labels (supports, refutes, or not enough info) to single output tokens and directly train with\\nclaim-class pairs. Crucially, unlike most other approaches to FEVER, we do not use supervision on\\nretrieved evidence. In many real-world applications, retrieval supervision signals aren’t available, and\\nmodels that do not require such supervision will be applicable to a wider range of tasks. We explore\\ntwo variants: the standard 3-way classiﬁcation task (supports/refutes/not enough info) and the 2-way\\n(supports/refutes) task studied in Thorne and Vlachos [57]. In both cases we report label accuracy.\\n4 Results\\n4.1 Open-domain Question Answering\\nTable 1 shows results for RAG along with state-of-the-art models. On all four open-domain QA\\ntasks, RAG sets a new state of the art (only on the T5-comparable split for TQA). RAG combines\\nthe generation ﬂexibility of the “closed-book” (parametric only) approaches and the performance of\\n\"open-book\" retrieval-based approaches. Unlike REALM and T5+SSM, RAG enjoys strong results\\nwithout expensive, specialized “salient span masking” pre-training [ 20]. It is worth noting that RAG’s\\nretriever is initialized using DPR’s retriever, which uses retrieval supervision on Natural Questions\\nand TriviaQA. RAG compares favourably to the DPR QA system, which uses a BERT-based “cross-\\nencoder” to re-rank documents, along with an extractive reader. RAG demonstrates that neither a\\nre-ranker nor extractive reader is necessary for state-of-the-art performance.\\nThere are several advantages to generating answers even when it is possible to extract them.

RAG approaches state-of-the-art model performance, which is\\nimpressive given that (i) those models access gold passages with speciﬁc information required to\\ngenerate the reference answer , (ii) many questions are unanswerable without the gold passages, and\\n(iii) not all questions are answerable from Wikipedia alone. Table 3 shows some generated answers\\nfrom our models. Qualitatively, we ﬁnd that RAG models hallucinate less and generate factually\\ncorrect text more often than BART. Later, we also show that RAG generations are more diverse than\\nBART generations (see §4.5).\\n4.3 Jeopardy Question Generation\\nTable 2 shows that RAG-Token performs better than RAG-Sequence on Jeopardy question generation,\\nwith both models outperforming BART on Q-BLEU-1. 4 shows human evaluation results, over 452\\npairs of generations from BART and RAG-Token. Evaluators indicated that BART was more factual\\nthan RAG in only 7.1% of cases, while RAG was more factual in 42.7% of cases, and both RAG and\\nBART were factual in a further 17% of cases, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of RAG on\\nthe task over a state-of-the-art generation model. Evaluators also ﬁnd RAG generations to be more\\nspeciﬁc by a large margin. Table 3 shows typical generations from each model.\\nJeopardy questions often contain two separate pieces of information, and RAG-Token may perform\\nbest because it can generate responses that combine content from several documents. Figure 2 shows\\nan example. When generating “Sun”, the posterior is high for document 2 which mentions “The\\nSun Also Rises”. Similarly, document 1 dominates the posterior when “A Farewell to Arms” is\\ngenerated. Intriguingly, after the ﬁrst token of each book is generated, the document posterior ﬂattens.\\nThis observation suggests that the generator can complete the titles without depending on speciﬁc\\ndocuments. In other words, the model’s parametric knowledge is sufﬁcient to complete the titles. We\\nﬁnd evidence for this hypothesis by feeding the BART-only baseline with the partial decoding \"The\\nSun. BART completes the generation \"The SunAlso Rises\" isanovel bythis author of\"The Sun\\nAlso Rises\" indicating the title \"The Sun Also Rises\" is stored in BART’s parameters. Similarly,\\nBART will complete the partial decoding \"The SunAlso Rises\" isanovel bythis author of\"A\\nwith \"The SunAlso Rises\" isanovel bythis author of\"AFarewell toArms\" . This example shows\\nhow parametric and non-parametric memories work together —the non-parametric component helps\\nto guide the generation, drawing out speciﬁc knowledge stored in the parametric memory.\\n4.4 Fact Veriﬁcation\\nTable 2 shows our results on FEVER. For 3-way classiﬁcation, RAG scores are within 4.3% of\\nstate-of-the-art models, which are complex pipeline systems with domain-speciﬁc architectures and\\nsubstantial engineering, trained using intermediate retrieval supervision, which RAG does not require.\\n6', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We calculate the overlap in article titles between the top kdocuments retrieved\\nby RAG and gold evidence annotations. We ﬁnd that the top retrieved document is from a gold article\\nin 71% of cases, and a gold article is present in the top 10 retrieved articles in 90% of cases.\\n4.5 Additional Results\\nGeneration Diversity Section 4.3 shows that RAG models are more factual and speciﬁc than\\nBART for Jeopardy question generation. Following recent work on diversity-promoting decoding\\n[33,59,39], we also investigate generation diversity by calculating the ratio of distinct ngrams to\\ntotal ngrams generated by different models. Table 5 shows that RAG-Sequence’s generations are\\nmore diverse than RAG-Token’s, and both are signiﬁcantly more diverse than BART without needing\\nany diversity-promoting decoding.\\nRetrieval Ablations A key feature of RAG is learning to retrieve relevant information for the task.\\nTo assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever\\nduring training. As shown in Table 6, learned retrieval improves results for all tasks.\\nWe compare RAG’s dense retriever to a word overlap-based BM25 retriever [ 53]. Here, we replace\\nRAG’s retriever with a ﬁxed BM25 system, and use BM25 retrieval scores as logits when calculating\\np(z|x). Table 6 shows the results. For FEVER, BM25 performs best, perhaps since FEVER claims are\\nheavily entity-centric and thus well-suited for word overlap-based retrieval. Differentiable retrieval\\nimproves results on all other tasks, especially for Open-Domain QA, where it is crucial.\\nIndex hot-swapping An advantage of non-parametric memory models like RAG is that knowledge\\ncan be easily updated at test time. Parametric-only models like T5 or BART need further training to\\nupdate their behavior as the world changes. To demonstrate, we build an index using the DrQA [ 5]\\nWikipedia dump from December 2016 and compare outputs from RAG using this index to the newer\\nindex from our main results (December 2018).

A single, pre-trained language model\\nhas been shown to achieve strong performance on various classiﬁcation tasks in the GLUE bench-\\nmarks [ 60,61] after ﬁne-tuning [ 49,8]. GPT-2 [ 50] later showed that a single, left-to-right, pre-trained\\nlanguage model could achieve strong performance across both discriminative and generative tasks.\\nFor further improvement, BART [ 32] and T5 [ 51,52] propose a single, pre-trained encoder-decoder\\nmodel that leverages bi-directional attention to achieve stronger performance on discriminative\\nand generative tasks. Our work aims to expand the space of possible tasks with a single, uniﬁed\\narchitecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pre-trained, generative language models.\\nLearned Retrieval There is signiﬁcant work on learning to retrieve documents in information\\nretrieval, more recently with pre-trained, neural language models [ 44,26] similar to ours. Some\\nwork optimizes the retrieval module to aid in a speciﬁc, downstream task such as question answering,\\nusing search [ 46], reinforcement learning [ 6,63,62], or a latent variable approach [ 31,20] as in our\\nwork. These successes leverage different retrieval-based architectures and optimization techniques to\\nachieve strong performance on a single task, while we show that a single retrieval-based architecture\\ncan be ﬁne-tuned for strong performance on a variety of tasks.\\nMemory-based Architectures Our document index can be seen as a large external memory for\\nneural networks to attend to, analogous to memory networks [ 64,55]. Concurrent work [ 14] learns\\nto retrieve a trained embedding for each entity in the input, rather than to retrieve raw text as in our\\nwork. Other work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over\\nfact embeddings [ 15,13]. A key feature of our memory is that it is comprised of raw text rather\\ndistributed representations, which makes the memory both (i) human-readable, lending a form of\\ninterpretability to our model, and (ii) human-writable, enabling us to dynamically update the model’s\\nmemory by editing the document index. This approach has also been used in knowledge-intensive\\ndialog, where generators have been conditioned on retrieved text directly, albeit obtained via TF-IDF\\nrather than end-to-end learnt retrieval [9].\\nRetrieve-and-Edit approaches Our method shares some similarities with retrieve-and-edit style\\napproaches, where a similar training input-output pair is retrieved for a given input, and then edited\\nto provide a ﬁnal output. These approaches have proved successful in a number of domains including\\nMachine Translation [ 18,22] and Semantic Parsing [ 21]. Our approach does have several differences,\\nincluding less of emphasis on lightly editing a retrieved item, but on aggregating content from several\\npieces of retrieved content, as well as learning latent retrieval, and retrieving evidence documents\\nrather than related training pairs. This said, RAG techniques may work well in these settings, and\\ncould represent promising future work.\\n6 Discussion\\nIn this work, we presented hybrid generation models with access to parametric and non-parametric\\nmemory. We showed that our RAG models obtain state of the art results on open-domain QA. We\\nfound that people prefer RAG’s generation over purely parametric BART, ﬁnding RAG more factual\\nand speciﬁc. We conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating\\nits effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hot-swapped to update the model\\nwithout requiring any retraining. In future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components\\ncan be jointly pre-trained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to BART or some\\nanother objective. Our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and non-parametric\\nmemories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a\\nwide variety of NLP tasks.\\n9', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

RAG could be\\nemployed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct beneﬁt to society, for example by endowing it\\nwith a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\\neffective at their jobs.\\nWith these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge\\nsource, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. Since RAG can be\\nemployed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [ 50] are valid here, although arguably\\nto a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in\\nthe news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of spam/phishing\\ncontent [ 54]. Advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the\\ncoming decades [ 16]. In order to mitigate these risks, AI systems could be employed to ﬁght against\\nmisleading content and automated spam/phishing.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe authors would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback on this\\npaper, as well as HuggingFace for their help in open-sourcing code to run RAG models.

These\\nanswer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer\\nannotations are used to ﬁnd matches within documents when preparing training data. For RAG, we\\nalso make use of multiple annotation examples for Natural Questions and WebQuestions by training\\nthe model with each (q,a)pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy. For TriviaQA,\\nthere are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets,\\nsuch as emoji or spelling variants. For TriviaQA, we ﬁlter out answer candidates if they do not occur\\nin top 1000 documents for the query.\\nCuratedTrec preprocessing The answers for CuratedTrec are given in the form of regular expres-\\nsions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answer-generation models [20].\\nTo overcome this, we use a pre-processing step where we ﬁrst retrieve the top 1000 documents for\\neach query, and use the answer that most frequently matches the regex pattern as the supervision\\ntarget. If no matches are found, we resort to a simple heuristic: generate all possible permutations for\\neach regex, replacing non-deterministic symbols in the regex nested tree structure with a whitespace.\\nTriviaQA Evaluation setups The open-domain QA community customarily uses public develop-\\nment datasets as test datasets, as test data for QA datasets is often restricted and dedicated to reading\\ncompehension purposes. We report our results using the datasets splits used in DPR [ 26], which are\\nconsistent with common practice in Open-domain QA. For TriviaQA, this test dataset is the public\\nTriviaQA Web Development split. Roberts et al. [52] used the TriviaQA ofﬁcial Wikipedia test set\\ninstead. Févry et al. [14] follow this convention in order to compare with Roberts et al. [52] (See\\nappendix of [ 14]). We report results on both test sets to enable fair comparison to both approaches.\\nWe ﬁnd that our performance is much higher using the ofﬁcial Wiki test set, rather than the more\\nconventional open-domain test set, which we attribute to the ofﬁcial Wiki test set questions being\\nsimpler to answer from Wikipedia.\\nE Further Details on FEVER\\nFor FEVER classiﬁcation, we follow the practice from [ 32], and ﬁrst re-generate the claim, and\\nthen classify using the representation of the ﬁnal hidden state, before ﬁnally marginalizing across\\ndocuments to obtain the class probabilities. The FEVER task traditionally has two sub-tasks. The\\nﬁrst is to classify the claim as either \"Supported\", \"Refuted\" or \"Not Enough Info\", which is the task\\nwe explore in the main paper. FEVER’s other sub-task involves extracting sentences from Wikipedia\\nas evidence supporting the classiﬁcation prediction. As FEVER uses a different Wikipedia dump to\\nus, directly tackling this task is not straightforward. We hope to address this in future work.\\nF Null Document Probabilities\\nWe experimented with adding \"Null document\" mechanism to RAG, similar to REALM [ 20] in order\\nto model cases where no useful information could be retrieved for a given input. Here, if kdocuments\\nwere retrieved, we would additionally \"retrieve\" an empty document and predict a logit for the null\\ndocument, before marginalizing over k+ 1predictions. We explored modelling this null document\\nlogit by learning (i) a document embedding for the null document, (ii) a static learnt bias term, or\\n(iii) a neural network to predict the logit. We did not ﬁnd that these improved performance, so in\\nthe interests of simplicity, we omit them. For Open MS-MARCO, where useful retrieved documents\\ncannot always be retrieved, we observe that the model learns to always retrieve a particular set of\\ndocuments for questions that are less likely to beneﬁt from retrieval, suggesting that null document\\nmechanisms may not be necessary for RAG.\\nG Parameters\\nOur RAG models contain the trainable parameters for the BERT-base query and document encoder of\\nDPR, with 110M parameters each (although we do not train the document encoder ourselves) and\\n406M trainable parameters from BART-large, 406M parameters, making a total of 626M trainable\\n18', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Despite the recent\\ncreative works in tackling FSL tasks, learning valid information rapidly from just a few or even zero samples still remains a serious\\nchallenge. In this context, we extensively investigated 200+ latest papers on FSL published in the past three years, aiming to present a\\ntimely and comprehensive overview of the most recent advances in FSL along with impartial comparisons of strengths and\\nweaknesses of the existing works. For the sake of avoiding conceptual confusion, we ﬁrst elaborate and compare a set of similar\\nconcepts including few-shot learning, transfer learning, and meta-learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel taxonomy to classify the\\nexisting work according to the level of abstraction of knowledge in accordance with the challenges of FSL. To enrich this survey, in each\\nsubsection we provide in-depth analysis and insightful discussion about recent advances on these topics. Moreover, taking computer\\nvision as an example, we highlight the important application of FSL, covering various research hotspots. Finally, we conclude the\\nsurvey with unique insights into the technology evolution trends together with potential future research opportunities in the hope of\\nproviding guidance to follow-up research.\\nIndex Terms —Cross-domain, Few-shot Learning, Fine Tuning, Meta learning, Transfer Learning.\\n!\\n1 I NTRODUCTION\\nRecent advances in hardware and information technology\\nhave accelerated the interconnection of billions of devices\\nin various IoT-enabled application domains. Smart and\\nadaptive devices are increasingly deployed in critical infras-\\ntructures such as health, transportation, industrial produc-\\ntion, environmental detection, home automation, and many\\nother justifying the Internet of Everything (IoE) frameworks.\\nThese massive number of terminal devices have been gen-\\nerating a huge amount of data, which need to be sent back\\nto the server for central processing and storage. Although\\nthe total amount of generated data at the edge is very large,\\nthe volume of every dataset generated by a single device or\\nsingle scene is extremely limited with very few samples.\\nTraditional data-driven and single-domain algorithms do\\nnot perform well in these settings. To this end, numerous\\nresearch has been conducted in exploring effective learning\\nmethods based on few samples and cross-domain scenes.\\nFew-shot learning (FSL) as well as meta-learning have in-\\nevitably emerged as a promising way. However, how to\\neffectively obtain valid information from small sample data\\nset or even cross-domain still remains the greatest challenge\\nfaced by FSL today.\\n(Corresponding author: Ting Wang.)\\n•Yisheng Song and Ting Wang are with the Engineering Research Center\\nof Software/Hardware Co-design Technology and Application, Ministry\\nof Education; the Shanghai Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Comput-\\ning; East China Normal University, Shanghai 200062, China (email:\\n71205902054@stu.ecnu.edu.cn; twang@sei.ecnu.edu.cn).\\n•Subrota K Mondal is with the Faculty of Information Technology, Macau\\nUniversity of Science and Technology, Macao, China (email: skmon-\\ndal@must.edu.mo).\\n•Jyoti Prakash Sahoo is with the Department of Computer Science &\\nInformation Technology, Institute of Technical Education and Research,\\nSiksha ‘O’ Anusandhan University, India (email: jpsahoo@ieee.org).Besides, data distribution in real-world scenarios of-\\nten has long-tail effects and it is difﬁcult to generalize\\nthe same model across diverse domains. Taking the smart\\nmanufacturing industrial inspection as an example, such\\npoor generalization issue has become one of the key chal-\\nlenges affecting the performance of its intelligent models.\\nSpeciﬁcally, current industrial quality inspection equipment\\nrequires certain speciﬁc lighting conditions, and the AI\\nmodels trained under one lighting condition are difﬁcult\\nto ”generalize” to other lighting conditions. In addition,\\nconsidering the high accuracy requirements of industrial\\nquality inspection scenarios, current AI models, usually us-\\ning supervised learning, require a large number of defective\\nsamples for training. However, it is difﬁcult to collect a\\nsufﬁcient number of satisfactory samples as the proportion\\nof defective products in actual production scenes is small.\\nMoreover, it is not possible to transfer across domains either.\\nFor example, a model for PC appearance defect detection\\ncannot be directly used to detect defects of mobile phone\\nscreens, refrigerators, washing machines, or even different\\nmodels of PCs. Similarly, as another example, when recog-\\nnizing character images of components and circuit boards,\\nas there are many suppliers of components, many types of\\ndevices, and many different character styles, thus it is not\\npossible to collect a sufﬁcient number of all kinds of samples\\nof character images for one supplier, resulting in few or no\\nsamples of each type. Table 1 provides a detailed summary\\nof these challenges.\\nTo address these challenges more effectively, FSL has\\nproduced some creative work on data, algorithms, and\\nmodels.

Transfer learning is mainly combined with pre-\\ntraining and ﬁne-tuning to extract prior knowledge from\\nlarge-scale auxiliary data sets. When domain relevance is\\nrelatively uncommon or large auxiliary datasets are not\\navailable, transfer learning has deﬁnite limitations. Meta-\\nlearning is currently the mainstream approach to solve the\\nFSL problem. In recent years, some scholars have ques-\\ntioned ”Is such a kind of meta or episodic-training paradigm\\nreally responsible and optimal for the FSL problem?”. This\\nhas led to extensive discussions [1], [2] on the necessity\\nof meta-learning for FSL. As for multimodal learning, it\\nintegrates different dimensions of information, such as lan-\\nguage, images, and audio. Multimodal learning is expected\\nto break the dilemma of insufﬁcient useful information for\\nFSL in the real human information world.\\nDue to the speciﬁcity of FSL, each method of FSL is\\nconfronting multifaceted challenges to varying degrees. One\\nof the most direct challenges in data augmentation is that\\nthe data samples are too limited and the model cannot\\nevaluate the true data distribution by relying solely on a\\nfew samples. As a result, the model trained in this setting is\\nbiased and easily falls into over-ﬁtting. In transfer learning,\\nfeatures can effectively alleviate the problem of FSL, where\\nthe volume of data is small and cannot be migrated across\\nsimilar domains. Nevertheless, how to represent features\\neffectively, how to reuse features between different tasks,\\nand how to establish an effective mapping between data\\nand labels are great challenges that exist in transfer learning.\\nMoreover, in the meta-learning paradigm, when training the\\nmeta-learner with a set of tasks, it not only samples the data\\nspace but also the task space. By constantly adapting to each\\nspeciﬁc task, it makes the network have an abstract learn-\\ning ability. When the training task and the target task are\\ndistinctly different, the effect of meta-learning is minimal.\\nFurthermore, in the ﬁeld of multimodal learning, extensive\\nstudies have been conducted to explore how to effectively\\nintegrate information from multiple modalities to assist the\\nFSL.\\nSeveral existing survey papers have investigated the re-\\nlated work of FSL, for instance, the work [3] categorizes FSL\\napproaches into experience learning and conception learn-\\ning. The work [4] classiﬁes FSL approaches into generative\\nmodels and discriminative models according to probability\\ndistribution. Lately, the work [5] proposes a new taxonomy\\nto classify the FSL approaches from the aspect of data,\\nmodels, and algorithms. Nevertheless, to the best of our\\nknowledge, no one paper has ever provided a taxonomyfrom the perspective of challenges in FSL. By summarizing\\nthe challenges of FSL, readers can better grasp the motiva-\\ntion and principle behind the FSL, rather than being limited\\nto various models. A list of key acronyms used in this paper\\nis summarized in Table 2.\\n1.1 Organization of the Survey\\nThe remainder of this survey is organized as follows.\\nSection 2 provides an overview of FSL, introducing FSL,\\ncomparatively analyzing machine learning, meta-learning,\\nand transfer learning along with summarizing the current\\nvariants of FSL and challenges.

In this sec-\\ntion, we will address the obstacles to FSL for readers by\\nanswering these questions.\\n2.1 What Is Few-Shot Learning?\\nThe concept of FSL is inspired by the robust reasoning and\\nanalytical capabilities of humans, and it is widely found\\nin edge computing scenarios. In 2020, Wang et al.

It is worth mentioning\\nhere that Ein FSL is very small. In recent years, relevant\\nneural scientiﬁc evidence [6], [7] has shown that innate\\nhuman abilities are related to various memory systems,\\nincluding parametric slow learning neocortical systems and\\nnon-parametric fast hippocampal learning systems, which\\ncorrespond to FSL’s data-based slow learning and feature-\\nbased fast learning, respectively.\\nTo better understand FSL, it is necessary to introduce\\ntwo concepts, one is N-way- K-shot problem and the other\\nis cross-domain FSL. The N-way- K-shot problem is often\\nused to describe the speciﬁc problems encountered by FSL.\\nIn this case, the support set represents the small dataset used\\nin the training phase, which generates reference information\\nfor the second phase of testing. The query set is the task on\\nwhich the model actually needs to predict. Notice that the\\nquery set classes never appear in the support set. Classical\\nN-way- K-shot represents support set with Ncategories\\nandKsamples per category, then the whole task has only\\nN∗Ksamples. As thus, N-way- 1-shot represents one-\\nshot learning and N-way- 0-shot represents zero-shot learn-\\ning. The concept of cross-domain originates from transfer\\nlearning, which refers to the transfer the knowledge from\\nsource domain to target domain. There usually exist domain\\ngaps between these domains. Cross-domain FSL integrates\\nthe features of cross-domain and FSL, and is a challenging\\ndirection that has recently emerged.\\nAt this stage, there still exist many challenges in FSL,\\nwhich are generated from various aspects, including but not\\nlimited to data, models, and algorithms. In this context, the\\nchallenges can be generally summarized according to the\\ndegree of integration of knowledge as follows:\\n•Inaccurate data distribution assessment :\\nFSL does not have access to large datasets due to\\ncosts, ethical, legal, or other reasons. Consequently,\\nrelying on few samples for learning produces biases\\nin estimating the actual data distribution, which\\nmay be fatal for some tasks. To this end, maximizing\\nthe exploration of data distributions with limited\\ninformation becomes the most signiﬁcant challenge\\nfor FSL. Data augmentation is the direct way to\\naddress the inaccurate estimation of FSL. The\\nprimary efforts currently focus on exploring\\nmigratable intra-class or inter-class features and\\ncustomizing speciﬁc images using generators.\\n•Feature reuse sensitivity : Continuous accu-\\nmulation of a priori knowledge by sampling large-\\nscale auxiliary datasets. Transfer learning can eas-\\nily use it from the source domain to the similar\\ntarget domain. Pre-training aims to extract high-\\ndimensional feature vectors through a feature extrac-\\ntor, while the goal of ﬁne-tuning is to make minor\\nadjustments to the initial parameters of the pre-\\ntraining. Transfer learning focuses on the data level\\nand obtains more valuable features independent of\\nthe task by mapping data to labels. It has an out-standing performance in optimizing speciﬁc tasks,\\nbut it is generally limited by the characteristics of\\ncurrent tasks and has a poor generalization to future\\ntasks. Especially when there is a large shift in the\\ndomain, without ﬁltering and alignment of features\\nmay result in negative knowledge transfer.\\n•Generality of future tasks : Differing from\\ntransfer learning, meta-learning learns to quickly\\nbuild mappings from known tasks to target models\\nin previously unseen tasks by double sampling the\\ntask and data. In FSL, by exploring the task space,\\nsummarizing meta-knowledge in different tasks can\\nresult in fast aggregation of unseen tasks at a lower\\ncost. As a general learning framework, meta-learning\\nis independent of speciﬁc problems and more ori-\\nented to future tasks instead of optimizing the cur-\\nrent one. However, meta-learning has proven effec-\\ntive only when the testing and training tasks are\\nrelatively similar, and it is highly depends on the\\nnetwork structure and lacks ﬂexibility. When training\\nmeta-learners with a set of tasks at the same time, it\\nis even difﬁcult to adapt to the distribution of tasks,\\nrequiring a redesign of the network structure.\\n•Defects of single-modal information : It is\\ndifﬁcult to learn features effectively because FSL\\nis inherently information-limited. This situation is\\nimproved to a great extent when aided by getting\\ninformation from other modalities. In this respect,\\nsemantic assistance [8], [9] is an excellent method\\nto provide external prior knowledge, where through\\nthe introduction or generation of semantic informa-\\ntion as weak supervision, adaptive classiﬁcation can\\nbe accomplished in conjunction with the original\\nmodel.\\n2.2 What Is Machine Learning And How It Is Different\\nFrom Few-shot Learning?\\nThe traditional Von Neumann computer architecture allows\\nusers to execute a series of instructions step by step in the\\nform of a program [10]. However, this method does not\\nwork in ML. On the contrary, ML uses large-scale datasets as\\ninput. Its judgment on a new sample is based on statistical\\nresults extracted by historical data. Now, the burgeoning\\nof 5G [11] provides massive connectivity for millions of end\\ndevices, enabling an interconnection of everything. The total\\namount of data generated by terminal devices is huge, but\\nthe amount of one single data set is extremely small. Hence,\\ntraditional ML, whose performance strongly depends on\\nlarge data sets, cannot perform well in this setting with few\\nsamples. To this end, FSL emerges and provides a promising\\nway to handle the data scarcity scenario.\\nIn recent ten years, the research on FSL has been ex-\\ntensively conducted, and signiﬁcant research progress has\\nbeen achieved, e.g. the KGBert [12] proposed by Alibaba\\nsurpasses humans in the ﬁeld of FSL for the ﬁrst time. Fig. 2\\nexhibits the statistics of paper publications related to FSL in\\nrecent ten years based on the statistical results of the Web of\\nScience. As revealed, there are relatively few related papers\\nfrom 2011 to 2015 due to that the FSL theory is still incom-\\nplete.

The knowledge graph uses Few-shot learning, One-shot learning\\nand Zero-shot learning as keywords to relate the main advances and\\nresearch directions in the ﬁeld of Few-shot learning in recent three\\nyears.\\nThe most signiﬁcant difference between FSL and tra-\\nditional machine learning is that the set of classes of the\\nsupport set and the query set are disjoint. In machine\\nlearning, the classes of the test set are included in the\\ntraining set in advance. FSL combines the limited supervi-\\nsion information with prior knowledge to train the model.\\nThe input of the model is generally given in the form of\\ntasks. Through continuously collecting tasks, the model canrecognize the similarities and differences between data as\\nwell as task. When the model encounters an unseen task,\\nknowledge transfer can be accomplished quickly with just\\na few iterative training steps with appropriate initializa-\\ntion parameters. In contrast, traditional machine learning\\nrequires optimization through the loss function generated\\nby a large scale data sets in the model. In conclusion, FSL\\nis only a very young branch of machine learning, which\\nmainly addresses the issue of difﬁcult access to quality data\\nsets in machine learning scenarios.\\n2.3 What Is Transfer Learning and How It Is Different\\nFrom Few-shot Learning?\\nTraditional transfer learning involves applying knowledge\\nlearned in the source domain to a different but related target\\ndomain. In FSL, the limited amount of training data, domain\\nvariations, and task modiﬁcations are the key factors that\\ncause the model to fail to transfer well from the source\\ndomain to the target domain. For instance, a medical image\\ndataset with low similarity to the natural image dataset\\nimagenet is difﬁcult to identify accurately without the help\\nof relevant expertise, even for a human-guided by only a\\nfew images. Certainly, it is also effective when the source\\ndomain and target domain are relative similar. The end in\\nFSL tasks, if the prior knowledge is obtained from other\\ntasks or domains by pre-training, FSL can belong to transfer\\nlearning, which mainly learns the mapping of data to labels.\\nAccording to the taxonomy of transfer learning, there are\\nmany variants of FSL problems, including one-shot learning\\n(OSL), zero-shot learning (ZSL), and cross-domain few-shot\\nlearning.\\n•One-shot learning : OSL has only one correct\\nlabel for each sample in the support data set, which\\naims to ﬁnd the most similar class as a match among\\nthe seen-classes. During the police interrogation,\\nthese two processes are incredibly similar. The wit-\\nness just looked once at the suspect, and the photos\\ngiven by the police can be regarded as the query\\nimage. The witness only needs to answer ’yes’ or ’no’\\ntowards those photos. Similarly, one-shot learning\\ndoes not classify the data speciﬁcally, but simply\\nmakes a cluster in order of similarity function. Ac-\\ncording to the existing work, one-shot learning can\\nbe divided into two main approaches. One is to use\\ngenerative models to caste prior knowledge [13], [14],\\n[15], where bayesian programming learning [16] is\\nthe most representative framework [17] in this ﬁeld.\\nAnother method is to convert a OSL classiﬁcation\\ntask into a veriﬁcation task [18], [19].\\n•Zero-shot learning : ZSL was ﬁrst proposed by\\nLampert et al. [20], which considers a more extreme\\ncase in FSL. In the absence of any query samples,\\nthe inference mechanism is solely relied on to iden-\\ntify samples that have not been seen before. ZSL\\nis essentially done by using high-dimensional se-\\nmantic features [21], [22], [23] to replace the low-\\ndimensional raw data. Embedding representations\\nand autoencoders are the most efﬁcient ways to\\nconstruct intermediate semantic spaces, which con-\\ntains attributes that more comprehensively deﬁne the', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Up to now, zero-shot learning is one of the\\nclosest methods to human intelligence that discerns\\npreviously unobserved categories. One-shot learning\\nand FSL can essentially be considered as special ZSL.\\n•Cross-domian few-shot learning : In transfer\\nlearning, each class in the target domain has a suf-\\nﬁciently large number of available samples. When\\na large domain shift occurs between the source do-\\nmains and target domains, knowledge transfer tends\\nto become very challenging. Cross-domain few-shot\\nlearning combines the challenges of transfer learning\\nand FSL. In the existence of domain gaps, where\\nthe intersection of classes in the source and target\\ndomains is empty, and the available sample size for\\neach class in the target domain is extremely small.\\nThe improvement of the model’s generalization ca-\\npability through source domain data alone brings\\nvery limited performance to the model. The present\\nwork mainly focuses on the shift transformation of\\nfeatures and the construction of auxiliary datasets.\\nCross-domian few-shot learning can be regarded as\\none of the most challenging setting in the ﬁeld of FSL\\nat present.\\n2.4 What Is Meta-Learning and How It Is Different From\\nFew-shot Learning?\\nMeta-learning is a general learning paradigm that provides\\ntraining on tasks in an episodic-training mechanism. Fig.\\n4 illustrates the three-steps involved in meta-learning [24]\\ntraining. Meta-learning focuses on improving generalization\\nfor unseen tasks using prior knowledge. If prior knowledge\\nis used to teach the model how to learn on a speciﬁc task,\\nmeta-learning can be regarded as a variant of FSL. It is\\nemphasized that meta learning is not equivalent to FSL.\\nFSL should be seen rather as an ultimate goal. It aims\\nto achieve robust generations without relying on a large\\nscale of datasets. By dual sampling of data and task space,\\nmeta-learning is enabled to construct a large number of\\nauxiliary tasks related to the unseen task. Even if some\\npapers do not use meta-learning, it is likely to improve the\\nmodel’s performance if episodic-training mechanism can be\\nconsidered, such as meta reinforcement learning [25], [26],\\nmeta video detection [27], and so on.\\nFig. 4. Meta-learning training three-step approach includes: ﬁnd the\\nlearning algorithm, deﬁne loss function using tasks, ﬁnd parameter that\\ncan minimze loss function.Nevertheless, meta-learning has its own limitations:\\nwhen the training and testing tasks exist obviously domain\\ngap, Meta-learning is rarely used to initialize parameter\\nweights. It can easily lead to negative migration of the\\nmodel. In addition, meta-learning is highly dependent on\\nthe structure of the network, and needs to be redesigned for\\nwidely varying tasks. In spite of this, meta-learning is still\\none of the most effective methods to solve FSL.\\n2.5 Datasets\\nBefore the availability of FSL benchmark datasets, re-\\nsearchers regularly used tasks like manually constructing N-\\nway-K-shots to evaluate the performance of models. How-\\never, these simple tasks cannot reﬂect the complexity of\\nreal-world problems. After 10 years of evolution, the FSL\\nbenchmark dataset has completed the transition from a\\nsingle domain, single dataset to a cross-domain, multiple\\ndataset.\\nAs shown in Fig. 5, during 2017-2021, 898 papers used\\nthe CUB-200-2011 [28] dataset, accounting for 46.6% of\\nthe total number of statistics; 587 papers used the Mini-\\nImageNet [29] dataset, accounting for 30.5%; and 335 papers\\nusing the Omniglot [30] dataset, accounting for 17.4% ; 44\\npapers used the PASCAL-5i [31] dataset, and 46 papers\\nused the Meta-DataSet [32]. The other speciﬁc datasets are\\nParis-Lille-3D [33], N-Digit MNIST [34], SUN397 [35], which\\nare used in 15 papers in the past ﬁve years. In terms of\\nquantity, the CUB-200-2011, Mini-ImageNet, and Omniglot\\nbenchmark datasets occupy a dominant position in the ﬁeld\\nof FSL. Table. 3 compares the datasets mentioned above\\nfrom different dimensions. By the publication of the article,\\na more objective benchmark dataset [36] for evaluating the\\ncross-domain ability of FSL was proposed. 1) CropDiseases\\n[37], a plant diseases dataset , 2) EuroSAT [38], a dataset for\\nsatellite images, 3) ISIC [39] a medical skin image dataset, 4)\\nChestX [40], a dataset for X-ray chest images. The similarity\\ncomparing to MiniImageNet is decreas across these datasets.\\n2.6 Taxonomy\\nAccording to the degree of integration of knowledge, FSL is\\nbroaderly divided into a single-modal learning and a multi-\\nmodal learning. In this survey, The single-modal learning\\ncan be further divided into data augmentation, transfer\\nlearning, and meta learning. It mainly focuses on abstracting\\nor transferring limited information into higher-level feature\\nvectors or meta-knowledge. Multimodal learning is more\\nclose to the real world of human intelligence, which no\\nlonger relies on the limited sample, and tries to ﬁnd the\\nspace of other modalities to assist the FSL. With this tax-\\nonomy, we exhaustively review and discuss each method.\\nFig. 6 vividly demonstrates the FSL’s taxonomy under the\\nchallenge perspective.\\n•Evaluate The True Data Distribution : The\\nkey to the difﬁculty of FSL is that limited samples\\ncannot reﬂect the actual data distribution.

Pre-\\ntraining and ﬁne-tuning assist FSL by learning ef-\\nfective representation of data to labels, coupled with\\neffective regularization of the underlying semantic\\nfeatures.

To mitigate this issue,\\ndata augmentation is recognized as the most direct way\\nto increase the sample richness in FSL. Nevertheless, the\\ncore risk of the FSL data augmentation is how likely the\\naugmented dataset can evaluate the distribution behind the\\nreal data. Based on whether the data augmentation tech-\\nniques can be reused on other tasks, FSL data augmentation\\nis divided into hand-crafted rules and automatic learning\\ndata processing.\\n3.1 Hand-Crafted Rules\\nHand-Crafted rules require guidance from experts with\\nspecialized domain knowledge. A representative result is\\nthat Bouthillier et al. proposed to randomly discard pix-\\nels [41] on a random rectangular area to generate black\\nrectangular blocks of simulated noise. Similar operations\\nalso include random erase [42] and ﬁll [43], [44] in FSL.\\nNevertheless, brieﬂy relying on the simple transformation of\\nsingle-sample pixels cannot prevent the risk of overﬁtting.\\nFurther, the hand-crafted rules contains data level and fea-\\nture level according to the dimension of information.

Random erasure [42] and random cropping\\n[43], [53] are classical algorithms by simulating the images\\nwith different degrees of damage and thus improving the\\ngeneralization of the model. Inspired by this, Li et al.\\n[46] discarded the traditional approach based on a entire\\nfeature extractor for images and instead focused on local\\npatch images. These methods require large-scale datasetsas support. It is not easy to achieve in the FSL settings.\\nConversely, CSEI [46] does not require extra data sets. The\\nspeciﬁc operation is to erase most of the discriminatory area\\nin the support set derived from the metric function and\\nreplace it with an image ﬁll using the restoring operation.\\nFTT [45] enriches the data set by linear interpolation of some\\ntransiently transformed attributes, such as different weather\\nand lighting.

[15] proposes an end-to-end\\napproach to partitioning images as a whole inspired with\\nthe idea of MIXUP [54], which argues that images preserve\\nimportant semantic information even after they have un-\\ndergone various distortions. The most signiﬁcant difference\\nbetween image distortion and GNN is that image distortion\\nsimply stitches two images together in a linear pattern. This\\nmethod is able to achieve maximum deformation without\\nloss of classiﬁcation. In addition, it is a good direction for\\ndata expansion by using the large amount of unlabelled data\\nsets in the real world for supplementation. Finally, when\\nboth the source and target classes both have only a limited\\nnumber of samples, AdarGCN’s [47] implementation crawls\\ndata from internet resources and automatically removes\\nirrelevant noise to achieve controllable data augmentation.\\nAt the same time, AdarGCN can automatically determine\\nhow far the information has been propagated in each graph\\nnode. In conclusion, data augmentation at the data level\\nfocuses on increasing the number of samples by means of\\npixel transformations and pixel generation.

Feature level-based data enhancement can be mainly divided into\\nglobal features and local features. Global features focus on the whole\\nimage, including the foreground and background.

It carries more\\nvalid information than mere original pixels. Gao et al. [48]\\nﬁrst explored the underlying distribution behind few-shot\\ndata and proposed an adversarial covariance augmentation\\nnetwork to overcome the limitations of FSL. Its experiments\\nhave shown that relying solely on learning the features of\\nthe entire image brings noise into the results. Chu et al.\\n[49] tried to compute feature representations for each patch,\\nrather than the entire image. Each small patch is connected\\nby RNN and the features of the image are further fused.\\nThis heuristic algorithm is far superior to simple attentional\\nmodels[55]. Zhang et al.

Through\\nthe combination of meta-learning with other data augmen-\\ntation methods, a large amount of excellent work emerged\\nduring this period. Hu et al. [57] was inspired by the\\nDARTS algorithm to abstract the data augmentation into\\nmultiple sub-strategies, each with a certain probability of\\nbeing selected according to the different few-shot tasks. In\\naddition to the probability-based method, another approach\\nis based on generation. Li et al. [58] proposed the adversarial\\nfeature phantom network-AFHN. The phantom diversity\\nand discriminative features are conditional on a small num-\\nber of labelled samples. Chen et al. [56] attempt to train a\\nmeta-learner and generate a network to learn similaritiesand differences between images end-to-end by fusing pairs\\nof images. MetaGAN [59], on top of which an adversarial\\ngenerator conditional on the task is introduced, which helps\\nFSL tasks form generalizable decision boundaries between\\ndifferent classes. On the other hand, Zhang et al. [50] further\\ndemonstrate the usefulness of phantom data generation for\\nFSL and propose a low-cost automated data generation\\nmethod that uses a direct foreground-background combi-\\nnation to generate feature space-level data for training. In\\naddition, it is also effective to explore the migratable differ-\\nences between and within classes in support datasets. Delta-\\nencoder [60] uses auto-encoder [61] to learn differences in\\nthe same class for transfer learning, which is different from\\nmetric-based computation [62] of visual similarity.

Fig. 9 shows the main approaches involved\\nin auto-learning data processing under FSL.\\n3.3 Discussion and Summary\\nTo maximize the evaluation of the distribution of the real\\ndata in FSL setting, data augmentation has from the hand-\\ncrafted rules to the auto learned data processing stage. The\\nwatershed is the maturity of meta-learning in 2018. This\\nsection comprehensively investigates the emerging repre-\\nsentative technologies in the ﬁeld of data augmentation and\\nreviews the evolution of few-shot data augmentation.

The basic operation is to pre-\\ntrain the model on an extensive dataset and then ﬁne-\\ntune on the limited support set. When source and target\\ndomains exist a large gap, knowledge transfer is invariably\\nmuch less effective. This cross-domain setting brings a new\\nchallenge for FSL. In FSL, transfer learning can be broadly\\ndivided into pre-training and ﬁne-tuning stage, which can\\nalso be referred to the baseline. Fig. 10 illustrates the general\\nprocess.\\n4.1 Pre-training and Fine-Tuning\\nFrom 2012 to 2018, a large number of excellent works\\nhave emerged in the ﬁeld of computer vision and natural', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In particular, the\\narea of natural language processing was slow to progress\\nbefore the advent of pre-training models. It has grown\\nconsiderably under the leadership of BERT as computing\\npower has increased and excellent pre-training models have\\nbeen proposed.\\nAs a downstream task, how to use these excellent models\\nto obtain features will largely alleviate the pressure on the\\ndata for FSL. Especially for few-shot image classiﬁcation, as\\na pre-training model [71], [72], it needs to use an external\\nlarge-scale label dataset to extract prior knowledge from\\nsimilar task. The most common practice is to design a back-\\nbone model without classiﬁer layer, which includes convo-\\nlutional neural networks or auto-encoders. The input of the\\nmodel is an array of images, and the output is the feature\\nvector embedding in a high-dimensional space [73]. High-\\ndimensional feature vectors obtain sufﬁcient valid semantic\\ninformation about the target image. After the pre-training\\nwas put forward, the researchers proposed ﬁne-tuning later.\\nMost parameters in the pre-training are frozen, and only the\\nclassiﬁcation layer parameters are updated in the testing\\nstage. Many recent works [74], [1] have proved that ﬁne-\\ntuning can improve the 5-way-1-shot tasks accuracy rate\\nby 2%-7% compared with the baseline model. Although the\\nnumber of samples in the support set and query set is small,\\npre-training and ﬁne-tuning are still very helpful for im-\\nproving the accuracy of FSL. The conclusions are analogous\\nin natural language processing as well. The authors in [75],\\n[76], [77] have also shown that ﬁne-tuning can be embeddedin state-of-the-art meta-learning or semi-supervised learn-\\ning frameworks for optimizing model parameters.\\nDhillon et al. [76] replaced the standard activation\\nfunction with cosine similarity, and Nakamura et al. [74]\\nreplaced conventional gradient descent with an adaptive\\ngradient optimizer, which both improve the ﬁne-tuning\\nprocess in the accuracy of the model. Currently, ﬁne-tuning\\nis usually combined with meta-learning. Cai et al. [78]\\nattempted to integrate them to train networks with speciﬁc\\nlayers. However, experimental results suggest that since the\\nsupport and query sets do not overlap in FSL setting, trans-\\nferring whole knowledge from the source dataset is not the\\nbest solution for FSL. Shen et al. [79] suggest that knowledge\\nshould be transferred speciﬁcally for parts. The degree of\\ntransferability needs to be controlled by freezing or ﬁne-\\ntuning speciﬁc layers in the backbone model. Similarly, ﬁne-\\ntuning can also be used to prevent new classes of networks\\nfrom polluting the feature space of the basic classes. Up to\\nnow, the FSL and ﬁne-tuning have been widely used in tasks\\nlike plant disease and insect pest identiﬁcation [80], road\\ndetection [81], and automatic question and answer [82].\\n4.2 Cross-Domain Few-shot Learning\\nThe latest progress of FSL largely depends on the labelled\\ndata of the training stage. However, it is unrealistic to collect\\nvarious forms of datasets for speciﬁc tasks in many practical\\napplications, which results in challenging of FSL between\\nintensely different domains. Cross-domain few shot learn-\\ning integrates FSL and domain adaptive problems, which\\nis a relatively comprehensive and challenging setting. For\\na long time, the benchmark datasets commonly used for\\nFSL have suffered from a standardized dataset structure\\nand large similarity of natural scenes, which leads to that\\nmodels perform well on standard datasets but get unac-\\nceptable results in the real world task.

According\\nto the degree of similarity with the ImageNet, it is divided\\ninto CropDiseases [37], EuroSAT [38], ISIC [39], ChestX [40].\\nThe authors extensively evaluate the performance of current\\nFSL methods, and experiments show that the accuracy of\\nall methods is correlated with the proposed natural image\\ndata similarity metric.

Based on this, FRN [84] explores the po-\\ntential space for few-shot image classiﬁcation, using ridge\\nregression to reconstruct and normalize the feature map\\nwithout adding new learning parameters.

Up to now, most of the meta-learning models are\\nupdated with parameters using traditional gradient descent.\\nAbsolutely, there are also non-gradient descent methods\\nbased on reinforcement learning and metric methods. In\\nFSL, meta-learning can be used to automate the learning\\nof model parameters, metrics function, and the transfer of\\ninformation\\n5.1 Learning Model Parameters\\nMost of the deep learning frameworks use different param-\\neter initialization methods, such as uniform distribution,\\nnormal distribution, and so on. The biggest problem with\\nthis random initialization is that it easily falls into the local\\noptimal position. The goal of meta-learning is to train a hy-\\nperparameter generator, the classical methods being MAML\\n[94], Repital [95] even their derived variants. MAML iden-\\ntiﬁes the global optimization direction by calculating the\\noptimization direction for each task. Compared to MAML,\\nReptile can update fewer parameters at once. The biggest\\ndifference between meta learning and multi-task learning is\\nthat multi-task learning only focuses on the performance\\nof the current task. Meta-learning was demonstrated to\\nperform better than transfer learning with a standard FSL\\nbenchmark dataset. Nevertheless, meta-learning is more\\nsensitive to network structure and requires ﬁne tuning of\\nhyperparameters. After that more versions have evolved\\nto address these issues separately.

TAML [98] is a\\ntask-independent method, which overcomes the problem\\nthat MAML can only use an external model.

To our best knowledge, the shared\\n[110] and randomly selected supernet weights [111], [112]\\nwere early solutions for FSL. Recently, a large volume of\\nwork [112], [113], [114] has shown that performance differ-\\nences still exist between one-shot NAS and traditional NAS.\\nThe one-shot NAS uses weight-sharing networks to train the\\nsupernetwork only once and then perform a single round\\nof inference to get an accurate prediction, greatly reducing\\nthe amount of computation required for the experiment.\\nSubsequently, Zhao et al. [115] proposed the few-shot NAS\\nbased on one-shot NAS. The core idea is to divide the\\nsupernets into multiple sub-supernets to search different\\nregions of the search space. With a slight increase in the\\nnumber of supernets, the accuracy of few-shot NAS is\\ngreatly improved. MetaNAS [116] is the ﬁrst method that\\ncompletely integrates meta-learning and traditional NAS.\\nMetaNAS be capable of better initialization parameters with\\nthe help of meta-learning ideas. It completely replaces the\\nweighted summation in the DARTS algorithm to reduce\\ndifferent operations, and the experimental results also show\\nthat it is more adaptable to more downstream learning tasks.\\n5.2 Learning Metric Algorithm\\nMetric learning [117] is different from classical meta-\\nlearning, metric learning no longer divides the model into\\ntraining and testing stages. In many previous papers [4], [5],\\n[3], [118], metric learning is always introduced separately.\\nIn our context, metric learning will be explained under the\\nframe of meta-learning. Fig. 11 illustrates one of the most\\nrepresentative learning methods, which is based on a proto-\\ntype network that has been improved to obtain substantial\\nimprovements on a benchmark dataset for classiﬁcation\\ntasks.\\nThe siamese neural network [119] is a relatively early\\nmodel in the metric learning. It can be simply regarded\\nas a binary classiﬁcation problem. The input to the model\\ncomposes of a set of positive or negative sample pairs, and\\nthe model needs to evaluate the similarity of the images\\nduring inference stage. Triple loss [120] is another way to\\ndeal with more than pairs input in FSL metric learning.\\nContrary to the Siamese neural network, triple loss requires\\npositive samples, negative samples, and anchor samples to\\nbe available at the same time. If training samples are easilydistinguished from each other, this would not be beneﬁcial\\nfor the model to better learn discriminative features. The\\nhard sample selection technique [121] incorporates the ab-\\nsolute distance between positive sample pairs in addition\\nto considering the relative distance between positive and\\nnegative samples. In addition to this, Li et al. [122] revisited\\nthe classical triplet network and extended it to a K-tuple\\nnetwork for FSL.\\nCompared to the Siamese neural network, the prototype\\nnetwork [123] realizes the true meaning of classiﬁcation. The\\nmost signiﬁcant difference is that the model allows for more\\ndata as input. By feature averaging it is feasible to ﬁnd the\\nmost representative sample as a prototype. However, simple\\nfeature averaging is easily disturbed by noise. On this basis,\\nmany works [124], [125], [126], [127], [128] have explored\\nhow to make the distance between prototypes larger and\\nlarger. One of the most representative works is the proposal\\nof positive and negative margins [129], which further reduce\\nthe over-ﬁtting and enhance the generalization based on\\nmaximizing the discriminative ability of the model.\\nEmbeeding\\nModuleFeature Vector For Support Set\\nClass 1Class 2\\n…Class M\\nFeature Vector For Query SetSupport\\n Set\\nQuery\\n Set\\n…\\nClass 1 Class 2 Class M\\n…Pull PushNearest Neighbor Ideas\\nPrototypical\\nLearningAttentive\\nPrototypical\\nCompute\\nDistanceCompute\\nPosterior\\nFig. 11. The framework [128] performs end-to-end learning of the em-\\nbedding model and prototype learning jointly, and the learned embed-\\nding features are used to compute the distance between the query\\nimage and the prototype, pushing the distance between different classes\\nfarther and bringing the distance between the same classes closer.\\nMatching Networks [29] is a more general network\\nframework that maps few-shot datasets and unlabeled data\\nto vectors in the embedding space.

In contrast to the Siamese neural\\nnetworks and prototype networks, relational networks can\\nbe seen as providing a learnable nonlinear classiﬁer for\\ndetermining relationships. The classiﬁer can be a feature\\nextractor of a pre-trained neural network [122] or a multiple\\nembedded module [134]. The most signiﬁcant contribution\\nof the relational network is that it breaks away from a single\\nlinear metric function and explores the use of an alternative\\nmodel to generate similarity. Table. 7 categorizes each of the\\nrepresentative metric learning algorithms, comparing their\\ninnovations on the original approach.\\n5.3 Learning To Transmit Information\\nIt is proved that graph neural networks (GNNs) [137] have\\nperformed well on relational-based tasks in recent years\\n[138]. Researchers have found that its classes-based transfer\\nof information can work well to help FSL learn to identify\\nnew class, while avoiding these classes being dominated\\nby proprietary features. Primarily, early graph neural net-\\nworks simulate the propagation of weights between differ-\\nent nodes by creating full connections between support and\\nquery sets. The nodes can be represented by either a one-\\nhot encoding or an embedding vector, and the connections\\nbetween nodes can be passed through edges. Given the\\ncomplexity of graph neural network algorithms, most graph\\nneural networks currently have a shallow number of layers.\\nIn order to better accommodate FSL, graph neural networks\\nhave been uniquely designed with nodes and edges in\\nrecent developments. Fig. 12 shows a recent representative\\nalgorithm for FSL of graph neural networks from the per-\\nspective of exploring small sample distributions.\\nDistribution\\nGraph\\nembf…generation 1 generation 2 … generation n\\nPoint\\nGraph …Prediction\\nFig. 12. DPGN [139] is concerned with the relationship between samples\\nin GNN, in addition to the relationship between sample distributions.\\nWhere Point Graph is used to describe the samples and Distribution\\nGraph is used to describe the distribution. The two GNNs fuse the\\ninstance-level and distribution-level relationships by passing information.\\nThe EGNN uses vertex sets, edge sets, and task sets to\\nencode the labels of nodes. When updates occur between\\nnodes, both the similarity and the difference are considered,\\nwhich greatly improves the generalization performance of\\ngraph neural networks to FSL. Meta-GCN [140] further\\nincorporates the idea of meta-learning, which enables the\\nupdating of weights of graphs under FSL to also be opti-\\nmized according to the gradient descent steps, the wholeprocess requires very few gradient steps and can receive\\nnew data quickly. Subsequently, several models based on\\nimprovements in the graph structure itself have emerged.\\nThe prototype network was improved by GFL [141] network\\nthat focuses on learning small samples of data with a graph\\nstructure. DPGN uses a dual graph neural network that de-\\nscribes samples while modelling their distribution. Further-\\nmore, GERN [142] uses embedding of graph neural network\\nconnections to achieve more robust intra-class weight trans-\\nfer. Nevertheless, none of these approaches addressed the\\nproblem of shallow layers of graph neural networks until\\n2021, HGNN [143] designed three sections of bottom-to-top,\\nand skip connections to remove the pitfall of ordinary GNNs\\nlosing the hierarchical association between nodes. Based on\\nthis, Frog-GNN [144] uses multidimensional information to\\nsynthesize information about the adjacency between nodes\\nto form pairwise relational features of intra-class similarity\\nand inter-class dissimilarity. At present, graph neural net-\\nworks are widely used for tasks such as few-shot image\\nclassiﬁcation [145], [146], semantic segmentation [147] and\\ninstance segmentation tasks.\\n5.4 Discussion and Summary\\nIn FSL, meta-learning mainly explore the mapping from the\\ntask to the target model. It trains a super-tuning device\\nthat gives a good set of hyperparameters as it converges\\naccording to the different tasks. In contrast to multi-task\\nlearning, which learns only focus on single task. However,\\nmeta-learning is not universal for all conditions. The current\\nidea of meta-learning is to have enough historical tasks. If\\nthere are not enough tasks on certain problems, then meta-\\nlearning may not be able to solve those problems. Similarly,\\nif the domain gap between source and target is too large, the\\nresults will also become terrible.\\n6 M ULTIMODAL COMPLEMENTARY LEARNING OF\\nSMALL SAMPLES WITHLIMITED INFORMATION\\nUntil now, FSL has made signiﬁcant progress in the uni-\\nmodal domain. Within unimodal learning, models are pri-\\nmarily responsible for representing information as feature\\nvectors that can be processed by a computer or further\\nabstracted into higher-level semantic vectors. Particularly,\\nmultimodal learning in FSL refers to learning better feature\\nrepresentations by exploiting complementarities between\\nmultiple modalities and removing redundancies between\\nmodalities. In real life, when parents teach their babies\\nabout things, they always include general information along\\nwith semantic descriptions. This is crucial for FSL, which\\ninherently comes with little valid information to make a\\ngood evaluation of the data or feature distribution. Inspired\\nby this, many research works [8], [148], [149] consider the\\nintroduction of other modal information when solving FSL.\\nBy fusing multimodal information, the ability of the model\\nto perceive small sample data can be improved. Fig. 13\\nshows the main paths of FSL under multimodality,\\n6.1 Multimodal embedding\\nRecent works [9], [148], [149], [150], [160] proved the limi-\\ntations of visual features for FSL of certain tasks.

Experiments have shown\\n[8], [148], [149] that adaptive combinations of two or more\\nmodalities are much better than unimodal FSL. Wang et al.[8] constructed weak semantic supervision for each category\\nby integrating multiple visual features. Schonfeld et al.\\n[149] instead used variational autoencoders (VAEs) to model\\nsemantic features based on latent visual features. Subse-\\nquently, Schwartz et al. [150] and Peng et al. [151] further\\nextended the semantic information by adding classes labels,\\nattribute and natural language descriptions, and knowledge\\ninference. The additional semantic information is aligned\\nwith visual features by embedding loss functions [152] to\\nlargely reduce the cost of knowledge transfer. Based on\\nthis, Karpathy et al. [160] used multimodal alignment to\\nﬁnd potential correspondences that exist between image\\npatches in the training set images and their descriptive\\nutterances. Aoxue et al.

[157] explored semantic features from\\ndifferent sources, such as WordNet and word embeddings.\\nHowever, these methods were unable to recognize parts\\nof an image without part-term annotation. Elhoseiny et al.\\n[158] used a visual classiﬁer to detect patches from bird\\nimage dataset by using only text terms and tests without\\npartial annotation. The results show that visual text infor-\\nmation and bird parts can be linked with zero samples.\\n6.3 Discussion and Summary\\nMulti-modal FSL is still in the developing stage and there\\nare currently several challenges until now: how to combine\\ndata from heterogeneous domains, how to deal with the\\ndifferent levels of noise that occur during the combination\\nof different modalities, and how to learn together. Table.\\n8 classiﬁes FSL tasks in multimodality as representation,\\nalignment, fusion, co-learning, and translation. In a multi-\\nmodal FSL, a good feature representation should be able\\nto ﬁll in the missing modalities based on the observed\\nmodal information. More approaches will emerge in the\\nfuture, going well beyond modal embedding and generating\\nsemantic information from images.\\n7 FSL A PPLICATIONS INCOMPUTER VISION\\nIn the past ﬁve years, we systematically combed and sum-\\nmarized FSL in the ﬁeld of computer vision [161] and\\ndivided tasks into image classiﬁcation, object detection, se-\\nmantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Following\\nis a detailed summary in the form of graphs and tables\\nbased on the time dimension. By reading this section, the\\nreader will be able to gain a comprehensive grasp of FSL in\\nthe ﬁeld of computer vision.\\n7.1 Few-shot Image Classiﬁcation\\nExcept like Google and Facebook, most researchers in real\\nlife do not have access to a large dataset of good quality.\\nIn FSL computer vision classiﬁcation tasks, each task may\\ncontain only one or a few samples. Solving few-shot image\\nclassiﬁcation tasks is mainly addressed by data augmenta-\\ntion, transfer learning, meta-learning, and multimodal fu-\\nsion learning. At present, the top three methods in terms of\\naccuracy are all based on feature augmentation and feature\\ntransformation of the backbone model. In this section, we\\ninvestigates all few-shot image classiﬁcation models from\\n2016 to the present and counts the best performance of all\\nmodels on the mini-ImageNet benchmark dataset. Here we\\nuse 5-way-1-shot and 5-way-5-shot as baseline tasks. Table.\\n9 and Fig. 14 illustrate our investigation results.7.2 Few-shot Object Detection\\nFew-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) is the task of detecting\\nrare objects from several samples. There has been a lot of\\nprogress in FSL for image classiﬁcation, but rarely for object\\ndetection. At present the evolution of few-shot object detec-\\ntion can be divided into three main camps: Data augmen-\\ntation, transfer learning, and meta-learning. Out of them,\\nAttention mechanisms plays a pivotal role in small sample\\ntarget detection. Equally, the issue of slow inference for a\\nfew-shot object detections to meet real-time requirements\\nremains serious. The Table. 10 and Fig. 14 are used to show\\nrecent advances in object detection in FSL.\\n7.3 Few-shot Semantic Segmentation\\nFew-shot semantic segmentation was ﬁrst proposed in [31]\\nuntil 2017. And it has been widely used in scenes such\\nas medical images and driverless cars. Unlike traditional\\nsemantic segmentation, few-shot semantic segmentation has\\nless pixel annotation information in support data set. To\\nour best knowledge, few-shot semantic segmentation can be\\nbroadly classiﬁed into supervised semantic segmentation,\\nunsupervised semantic segmentation, and video semantic\\nsegmentation. In the machine learning stage, the more clas-\\nsical approach is to use probabilistic mappings as prior\\nknowledge for derivation. In the deep learning phase, a\\nlarge number of efﬁcient algorithms for segmentation tools\\nhave emerged, but these models often require a large num-\\nber of manual sample annotations. Recently, [201] has made\\nsigniﬁcant improvements to few-shot semantic segmenta-\\ntion by proposing a more concise paradigm where only the\\nclassiﬁer is meta-learned and the feature encoding decoder\\nremains trained using a conventional segmentation model.\\nProviding the Table. 16 and Fig. 14 for showing few-shot\\nsemantic segmentation.\\n7.4 Few-Shot Instance Segmentation\\nIn contrast to semantic segmentation, instance segmentation\\ninvolves identifying each pixel in an image and labelling\\nit separately. Recently, few studies are dealing with the\\nproblem of segmenting few samples of instances. Current\\nwork still focuses on how to improve R-CNNs using some\\neffective tools. The most recent work [210] proposes an in-\\ncremental few-shot instance segmentation algorithm, which\\ngreatly improves the performance on benchmark data sets.\\nIn this section, we survey papers of recent three years on\\nfew-shot instance segmentation. Table. 12 and Fig. 14 show\\nthe research progress of the few-shot instance segmentation.\\n8 F UTURE DIRECTION AND OPPORTUNITIES OF\\nFSL\\nConsiderable recent work has made promising progress\\non various task settings for FSL. Nonetheless, for more\\nchallenging scenes, both the training and validation data\\nsets are minimal, where the distribution of other data neither\\nhelps real samples to be evaluated nor has extensive training\\ndata or validation datasets for transfer learning. Moreover,\\nmeta-learning also does not have enough tasks to initialize\\nthe parameters.

Furthermore, recent advances in\\napplications and algorithms are also presented through this\\ncomprehensive survey of FSL.\\n8.1 Better evaluation of data distribution\\nThe essence of FSL is that the support data sets are too small\\nto evaluate the true data distribution. So what exactly can\\nbe done to maximize the evaluation of the true data distri-\\nbution using a limited number of samples? The latest work\\n[215] is making a useful attempt in this direction, proposing\\nthe idea of distribution correction where the mean and co-\\nvariance of the base class are computationally corrected and\\nthen a linear classiﬁer can be used directly to obtain good\\nresults. In fact, the difference between FSL and traditional\\ndeep learning is not big enough when the few samples are\\naccurate enough to estimate the true data distribution. This\\nis an exciting direction to explore. Similarly, in the ﬁeld of\\ncomputer vision, there are no task settings or datasets based\\non real application scenarios for FSL. Most of the work is\\nstill focused on leveraging and mining information from\\nimage data. The current mainstream benchmark datasets\\nhave more or less various problems: the mini-Imagenet\\ndataset has some inappropriate samples or too difﬁcult\\nsamples, such as solid occlusion, multiple objects in the\\nsame image, etc. The Omniglot dataset is far away frompractical applications and is not easily inspired in real-world\\napplications. BSCD-FSL [36] provides a more violent cross-\\ndomain FSL benchmark dataset involving satellite images,\\nmedical images. Until now there is no benchmark dataset\\nto evaluate the generalization ability of a model at a ﬁne\\ngrained detail. Developing and completing a benchmark\\ndataset in the ﬁeld of FSL will provide a more realistic\\nevaluation of the current state-of-the-arts in FSL.\\n8.2 Improving the robustness of data-to-label mapping\\nA new challenge to FSL is posed by the emergence of BSCD-\\nFSL. Its emergence explores and reveals the limitations of\\ncurrent FSL solutions for cross-domain learning. Recent\\nresearch has produced some excellent results in this area,\\nsuch as skillfully designed task tuning, more sophisticated\\nhyperparameter tuning, formation of auxiliary data sets,\\nand extraction of domain-irrelevant features. Currently, ﬁne-\\ntuning is already performing very robustly at the intersec-\\ntion of transfer learning and meta-learning. Nonetheless,\\nboth techniques are still very distinct. Pre-training can be\\nseen as learning many categories of tasks, but it is single-\\ntask learning. Meta-learning, on the other hand, is a multi-\\ntask learning approach.

In the case of\\nclassiﬁcation tasks, only associations between classiﬁcation\\ntasks can currently be considered. Is it possible to have a\\nframework that can take into account tasks such as classi-\\nﬁcation, detection, prediction, and generation at the same\\ntime? This would enable meta-learning to be somewhat\\nseparated from the conception of tasks. Some recent work\\nhas attempted to optimize each small batch as a whole. In\\nthis case, how to optimize the inner loop will be an im-\\nportant direction of optimization for efﬁcient applications.\\nIn the future, pre-training and ﬁne-tuning will become the\\nmainstream algorithms for FSL. At present, meta-learning is\\nstill exploring the correlation between tasks, and no relevant\\ntheory has yet emerged to explain the causal relationship\\nbehind meta-learning. As the causation theory framework\\nevolves, meta-learning would probably tend to become a\\nmore general framework.\\n8.4 Full convergence of multimodal information\\nMultimodal learning is currently an emerging approach for\\nsolving FSL problems by automatically learning small sam-\\nple tasks in edge scenarios without supervised information\\nand quickly migrating to data from different domains. Itis widely regarded as a path exploration from weak AI in\\nlimited domains towards general AI. The implementation\\nof pre-training and ﬁne-tuning in multimodal learning sce-\\nnarios can largely enable the usage of a uniform feature\\nrepresentation across different tasks. For instance, cross-\\nmodal understanding, and cross-modal generation. The\\nemergence of multimodal pre-training models can support\\nmultiple tasks, generalize across many scenarios, and have\\na substantial ability to generalize and replicate at scale.\\nExtensive work has been done on fusing two or more types\\nof information, including semantic information. Nonethe-\\nless, the main work is still focused on pixels and semantic\\ninformation, with a relatively single function. In order to\\neffectively address feature reuse under multiple modalities\\nand reduce the cost of data annotation, there is an urgent\\nneed for the industry to materialize a powerful pre-trained\\nmodel involving the fusion of three and more modalities.\\n9 CONCLUSION\\nAs an important branch of deep learning, few-shot Learning\\ndoes not require a large amount of data but chooses a\\nsofter approach to solve problems, where it can be perfectly\\nintegrated with techniques such as transfer learning, meta-\\nlearning and data augmentation. In this paper, we provide\\na comprehensive survey of FSL in the form of questions and\\nanswers that easily distinguish the confused concepts and\\nsummarize the rich baseline dataset under FSL. Besides, we\\nprovide unique insights into the challenges in the develop-\\nment of FSL following a new taxonomy.
